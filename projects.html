<p>I'm working on a few idea related to jobs, decision making and behavioural science </p>

<h3>Decision Tools</h3>
<p> Good decision making and implementation is hard. 70% of major projects fail to finish on time or on budget. We can do better.<p>

<p> From noticing a problem or opportunity, deliberating about a solution, and implementing your decision problems occur.<p>

<p> We can't avoid bad decisions. But we can use tools that make it more likely we will make good decisions.<p>

<p> At <a href="http://www.myredteams.com">My Red Teams</a> we're working on creating practical tools that teams can use to help them make good decisions on the projects or ideas they are working on. </p>

<h3>Behavioural Science in Practice</h3>
<p>With friends from the behavioural science community, we've created a small meet-up for practioners with a focus on leaders in the private and third sectors. Let me know if you'd like to join us or want more information. </p>
