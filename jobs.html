<p>A good job is defined by two areas. </p>

<p>First, the fundementals of a good wage, security and predictability. These are basic requirements.</p>

<p>Second, for a job to rise above foundational needs it must have elements of purpose, belonging, mastery and autonomy.</p>

<p>For many people, 21st century jobs are characterised by stagnating pay, uncertainty, and little connection to a wider purpose or meaning. Industrial decline, globalisation and automation have created new winners and losers. Solving for these challenges is - I think - one of the core policy tasks of our time.</p>

<p>Some examples of interesting thinking in this space:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://goodjobsinstitute.org/what-is-a-good-job/">Good Jobs Institute:</a> Zeynep Ton's work and advocacy is a good starting point for understanding what makes for a good job
  <li><a href=?https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/research?>Research of Nicholas Bloom:</a> A lot of good research on management and growth. <a href=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.33.3.163>This</a> paper providing a toolkit of policies to promote innovation is relevant for communities and cities trying to increase growth and employment.
  <li><a href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00NLHJKBE/>Work Rules by Laszlo Bock:</a> Yes, he's my boss. But also, clear-sighted explanations about what makes for truly meaningful work and - still non-existent in most companies - how to test if your people strategy is actually working.</li>
  <li>Pop academia is a useful launchpad into how to create good jobs. Some good reads are <a href="https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/">Dan Pink</a> and <a href="http://danielcoyle.com/the-culture-code/">Dan Coyle</a>
