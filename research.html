<h3>How cities revive after a large unemployment shock</h3>

<p>My masters research centred on working out what helped Australian cities grow employment and what made cities resilient following significant employment decline from 1971 to 2011.</p>

<p>I had two conclusions.</p>

<p>First, Australian cities can smooth and enrich but not escape fundamentals related to size, location, and industrial structure.</p>

<p>Second, there are generally two outcomes from a shock: population or participation decline. Because of social risks, resilient cities adjust with population changes and out-migration rather than lowering labour force participation.</p>

<p>For the Productivity Commission's report on Tranistioning Regional Communities I wrote a short <a href="https://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/213224/sub002-transitioning-regions.pdf">submission</a> based on my work. This is a more accessible version of my thesis.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>My dataset comes with a number of caveats and I consider it a work in progress. It is, to my knowledge, the first time a long-term panel dataset of Australian cities has been constructed.</p>

<p>If you would like to use the data, please get in contact.</p>
